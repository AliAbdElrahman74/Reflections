How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I think that it will make me more noticable about the mistakes I have done .

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

I think that If I can make the commits by  my own It will be understandable for me than the automatic one , it can commit within things i didn't finish .

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

In Git it will be more useful if the files are related to each others so if you need to change you will change in all the files nd they all in will be commited in that moment  but in Google Docs if they are related it will be more difficult to find the file that was in the time of editing n other file .

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

you can "cd" the repo then use git log to show all the recent commites and then use git diff to compare to commits by typing first_ID second_ID


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

because I can return to the previous commit easily and fix the bugs that i made .

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use it to contribute with my friends to pracitce an open source project .
