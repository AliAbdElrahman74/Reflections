What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

it will make a repo of my files and it will not make any commits .

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the difference is that it's an intermediate stage between working directory and git commits . it offers more control to add any files you need to commit separately.
